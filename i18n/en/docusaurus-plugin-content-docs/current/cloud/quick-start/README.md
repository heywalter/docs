# Quick Start

With the digital transformation of enterprises, traditional applications and architectures are no longer to meet the needs of enterprise business, and data islands have become the biggest issue.

In the past, data delivery often required significant time and effort to customize ETL logic or scripts, but these capabilities were often not easily reusable in other business scenarios and required repetition when requirements changed. Therefore, enterprises require a low-threshold approach to uniformly manage their data pipelines and achieve efficient data flow.
