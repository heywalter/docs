## Data Development

Tapdata Cloud allow you to add processing nodes between source and target data nodes, which can help you quickly accomplish data processing tasks like merging multiple tables, splitting data, and adding and removing fields. This article describes the process of creating data development tasks.

## Supported Data Sources

See [Supported Data Sources](supported-databases.md).

## Preparations

To use the data synchronization feature successfully, you need to deploy and plan your network access and set up access rights, for more information, see [Preparation](../prerequisites/README.md).
